    * Since the end of 2020, business picked up pace and grew significantly from mid-2021 onwards.
    * Revenue dips are observed at the beginning of each year, likely due to consumer fatigue following holiday sales. This trend is typical.

* Customer Growth:
   * In its first year of business, 2,630 unique customers generated an average revenue of approximately $2,500 each. Most of the customers bought a road bike, resulting in a higher revenue for customers.
   * The next year the number of unique customers grew 247%. The 9,000 customers had an average revenue of $1,000. An increasing number of customers opt to purchase lower-cost items rather than just bikes.

* Customer Demographic:
   * 41% of all customers belong to the low-income bracket, 46% to average, and 11% to high.
   * When broken down by occupation - 32% of customers are in skilled/manual work, 43% are professionals, and 24% are in management.
   * All customer segments grew in tandem, suggesting that marketing campaigns were likely broad-based and directed at the general public rather than tailored to specific demographics.

## Recommendations
* Revisit successful mid-2021 campaigns, partnerships, and promotions to increase repeat purchases. Target customers from this period with personalized offers and prioritize high conversion channels for the future. 
* Launch a new year promotion emphasizing upgrades and maintenance to offset early-year revenue dips due to post-holiday consumer fatigue. Roll out promotions on essential accessories.
* Offer discounts on merchandise that are relatively low in sale volume. Use AWC cap, the top-selling product, as an anchor for clothing promotions to drive sales.
* Focus on quality improvement and customer guidance for mountain bikes to reduce return rates. Introduce a quality assurance program and offer consultations to help customers select the right model for their needs.
* Analyze high-revenue demographics and shift from broad marketing to more targeted strategies for these key groups.
