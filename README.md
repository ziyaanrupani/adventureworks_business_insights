## Insights Deep Dive
### Revenue & Profitability
* AdventureWorks has generated nearly $25 million in total revenue, achieving a strong profit margin of approximately 42%, resulting in $10.5 million in profit.
    * This indicates effective cost management
* Revenue has shown a consistent upward trend since inception.
    * The business although producing revenue, initially struggled to gain momentum.
    * Since the end of 2020, business picked up pace and grew significantly from mid-2021 onwards.
    * Revenue dips are observed at the beginning of each year, likely due to consumer fatigue following holiday sales. This trend is typical.
* Monthly Revenue: For the most recent period, ADventure Works achieved $1.83 million in revenue showing a +3.31% increase over the previous month.
    * Most of the revenue is attributed as usual to the sale of bikes. It accounts for ~93% of total monthly revenue.
    * Accessories generated $90,000 with 1700 sales, which is a -7% and -5.5% decrease respectively.
    * Clothing generated $40,000 with 766 sales; +11.45% and +10.85 increase. This is quite a substantial increase over the previous month.
* Top Performing Products:
    * The top 6 mountain bikes generate significant revenue. Combined they account for 30% of Adventure Work's revenue. The average return rate between them although not high, is still considerable.
    * The most ordered bike type is the road bike, while the most returned is the touring type.   
    * The 30 oz water bottle is the most ordered product with a low return rate of 1.9%.
    * The top 5 most-selling products belong to accessories with a low return rate on average.
